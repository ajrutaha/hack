# Sense - Linux (Easy)

## Summary
Sense is one of the older boxes on HackTheBox. It's also a relatively easy box, focusing on using directory brute forcing to grab user credentials which provide access to a pfSense Firewall (hence the box name). This is one of the few times I have made the conscious decision to use Metasploit as I was not able to exploit the box using manual exploit vectors. Apart from this, it was nevertheless quite an enjoyable box and I got a lot out doing it.

## Enumeration

I began my Enumeration with a `Rustscan` scan of the target, picking up open ports which were then fed to `Nmap` for a more thorough scan

```
rustscan -a $machine_IP -- -A -sV -sC -T4 -v

-sC - Script Scan
-sV - Version Scan
-T4 - Timing Template
-A  - Aggresive Scan Options
-vv - Verbosity level

[!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers
[!] Your file limit is very small, which negatively impacts RustScan's speed. Use the Docker image, or up the Ulimit with '--ulimit 5000'.

```

This resulted in two ports, 80 (HTTP) & 443 (HTTPS). Port 80 didn't result in much so I targeted port 443 instead. 

### Port 443

```

This resulted in quite a few interesting files. One that stood out was `system-users.txt` which showed a valid username with an apparent indication of a default password in use.

![User-details](Images/userdeets.png)

Since we know that the target is a pfSense router, I tried using default credentials which worked!

![default-creds](Images/default-creds.png)

This ends up working and we are able to log in as the user `Rohit`

![burp](Images/burp.png)

![dashboard](Images/pfsense-dashboard.png)

Manually traversing through the webpage was fairly empty except the `status` page which provided a version number that might be helpful with further enumeration if necessary. 

Since the `Nmap` scan and the `Burp Repeater` tabs indicated a lighthttpd server present. I looked it up on Searchsploit butt it didn't lead to much.

I then searched for pfSense modules within Metasploit. 

```
msf6 > search pfsense

Matching Modules
================

```

Modules 2 & 3 are appropriate as we are currently authenticated and have access to pfSense. Going over the modules, module 2 seemed to be best suited as the Graph dashboard was something that I'd made a note of.

This worked like a charm and I was able to grab a root shell.
